To do this, some of them need my credentials because they dont have local admin... at some of the places ive worked, we would just give them admin and take it away immediately so it was gone when they logged back in, but here they dont want to do that because theyre concerned about users installing unwanted programs\n\nive been told that it's hit/miss if a user even needs admin credentials to map printers. Maybe its the printer, or maybe its the user.\n\nregardless, is there any alternative way to go about this so that we can resolve it remotely, without having to walk all the way over merely to type in our credentials?"},
		{"id":"4c4dac6966520bef","x":240,"y":-700,"width":1607,"height":1160,"type":"text","text":"Yes, there are several **secure and remote-friendly alternatives** to map printers without giving users local admin rights or physically walking over. Here‚Äôs a rundown with pros, cons, and best practices:\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ **1. Deploy Printers via Group Policy (GPO)**\n\n**Best for domain-joined environments**\n\n- **How**: Use **GPO ‚Üí User Configuration ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Control Panel Settings ‚Üí Printers** to push shared printers.\n    \n- **Admin Elevation Not Required**: If it's a shared printer on a print server, mapping typically does _not_ require elevation.\n    \n- **Trusted Print Server**: If the print server is not trusted, users may get a prompt; whitelist the server in GPO under:\n    \n    ```\n    Computer Config ‚Üí Policies ‚Üí Admin Templates ‚Üí Printers ‚Üí Point and Print Restrictions\n    ```\n    \n    Set `Users can only point and print to these servers` and disable warnings.\n    \n- **Pros**: Fully remote, scalable, no need for credentials\n    \n- **Cons**: Only works with shared printers, not direct IP printing\n    \n\n---\n\n### üî• **2. Use PowerShell Remotely (with elevated rights)**\n\n**Ideal for one-off or scripted deployments**\n\n- Run PowerShell from your machine or a jumpbox with this kind of command:\n    \n    ```powershell\n    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $UserPC -ScriptBlock {\n        Add-Printer -Name \"Printer01\" -DriverName \"HP Universal Printing PCL 6\" -PortName \"IP_192.168.1.100\"\n    } -Credential (Get-Credential)\n    ```\n    \n- Or for shared printers:\n    \n    ```powershell\n    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $UserPC -ScriptBlock {\n        Add-Printer -ConnectionName \"\\\\printserver\\Printer01\"\n    }\n    ```\n    \n- **Pros**: Fully remote, can batch script\n    \n- **Cons**: Needs remote PowerShell enabled and firewall configured\n    \n\n---\n\n### üöÄ **3. Deploy with Intune or RMM (Remote Monitoring & Management) Tools**\n\nIf you're using **Intune**, **PDQ Deploy**, **ConnectWise**, **Datto**, etc.:\n\n- Push scripts or packages that install printers automatically.\n    \n- Example PowerShell for direct IP printer:\n    \n    ```powershell\n    $portName = \"IP_192.168.1.100\"\n    Add-PrinterPort -Name $portName -PrinterHostAddress \"192.168.1.100\"\n    Add-Printer -Name \"Brother HL-L2350DW\" -DriverName \"Brother HL-L2350DW series\" -PortName $portName\n    ```\n    \n- **Pros**: Central control, remote, reusable\n    \n- **Cons**: Requires existing RMM tool or MDM policy\n    \n\n---\n\n### üîí **4. Elevation on Demand (Privileged Access Management Tools)**\n\nUse tools like:\n\n- **CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager**\n    \n- **BeyondTrust**\n    \n- **Admin By Request**\n    \n\nThese let users **request temporary elevation** for a task you approve, or allow elevation for only specific actions (like adding a printer).\n\n- **Pros**: Least privilege maintained, secure\n    \n- **Cons**: Needs licensing, setup\n    \n\n---\n\n### ‚ö†Ô∏è **5. Use `RunAs` with Saved Admin Credentials (Caution Advised)**\n\nYou can create a shortcut or script to run a printer installer or mapping command under admin:\n\n```cmd\nrunas /user:domain\\admin \"rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /in /n \\\\printserver\\printer\"\n```\n\nThis **doesn‚Äôt bypass UAC**, and storing credentials is insecure unless tightly controlled (e.g. using CredSSP or secure password vaults).\n\n- **Pros**: Quick fix\n    \n- **Cons**: Credential leakage risk\n    \n\n---\n\n### üí° TL;DR Recommendations\n\n|Use Case|Recommended Solution|\n|---|---|\n|Domain users, shared printers|**GPO with Point-and-Print**|\n|One-off printer setups|**Remote PowerShell**|\n|Scaling across org|**Intune, PDQ Deploy, RMM**|\n|High security|**Privileged Access Tools**|\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can generate a GPO config or script tailored to your environment (domain/workgroup, print server/direct IP, etc.). Just let me know the setup."}
